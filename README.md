# TopDownShooterGD4
Simple top down shooter ported to Godot 4 (Alpha 14) for this tutorial (by Miziziziz): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vYI_mgERBU

I've made a few very small changes to make this demo work. I'll try explaining everything in a future update. 

UPDATE: Cloning this repo should result in a fully working demo in Godot 4 Aplha 14! 

EDIT: Updated to Alpha 16. There is a really annoying Godot bug on Linux where the cursor would freak out and disappear if you change a value in the editor. You can just hit Return/Enter a couple times to get around it, but it's quite annoying nonetheless.
