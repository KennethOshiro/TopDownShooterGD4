# TopDownShooterGD4
Simple top down shooter ported to Godot 4 (Alpha 14) for this tutorial (by Miziziziz): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vYI_mgERBU

I've made a few very small changes to make this demo work. I'll try explaining everything in a future update. 


Note: you will have to set your input mappings in the Project Settings. 
This is because you are technically still importing a Godot 3 project. 

You will also have to set the target positions in the RayCast2D nodes. (500,0) should be plenty for both Player and Zombie.
